  - [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
  - [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
  - [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
  - [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
  - [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)

I also like science subjects (*such as mathematics, physics, chemistry*).
